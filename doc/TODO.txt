- Tagger todos:
  - add missing tests
  - finish similar objects method
  - duplicate insert detection in tag()
  - add routes and controllers for objects and users
  - some sort of db_select object for more reliable sql generation

- implement split read/write database support through Horde_Db, also allowing
  for sharding, multi-master, backup connections, etc. Probably will take a
  Horde_Db_ConnectionManager object or some such, that can implement logic for
  which connection to use.
